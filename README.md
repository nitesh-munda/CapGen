# CapGen
Caption generator application

## Use case
Capturing the perfect moment is just the first step in preserving memories. Often, finding the right
caption to complement your photo can be a time-consuming task. To address this, we present an 
innovative solution: an application that generates suitable captions based on the emotions or tags 
provided by the user, utilizing the advanced capabilities of Gemini AI.

This application streamlines the captioning process, allowing users to effortlessly enhance their 
photos with contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant captions. By analyzing the tags or 
emotions associated with the image, Gemini AI generates a caption that perfectly matches the 
sentiment and content of the photo.

This not only saves users valuable time but also ensures that their photos are shared with captions
that truly reflect the essence of the moment. Whether it's a joyous celebration, a serene landscape,
or a candid moment, our application delivers the perfect words to accompany the image.

Key Features:
Emotion and Tag-Based Analysis: Users can input tags or emotions, and Gemini AI will analyze these 
inputs to generate a fitting caption.
Time Efficiency: Quickly obtain suitable captions without the need to search the internet.
Contextual Accuracy: Captions are generated to accurately reflect the mood and context of the photo.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface ensures a seamless experience.
This application is ideal for social media enthusiasts, photographers, and anyone looking to enhance
their photo-sharing experience with minimal effort. By leveraging the power of AI, we bring a new 
level of personalization and convenience to photo captioning.

## Privacy and Security
1. Image Handling: We do not store users' images or access their photos without explicit consent 
   and permission.
2. Permission-Based Access: The application only processes the image that the user has selected and
   granted permission for.
3. Secure Data Transmission: Images are processed through an encrypted HTTPS call to obtain tags 
   from Gemini APIs, ensuring data security and user privacy.
